# guided-dives
This repo includes a set or jupyter notebooks and other scripts used as part of "guided dives" session, i.e. practical session where participants are guided through how specific aspects of data science, machine learning and deep learning are handled. 

Some of the nbs are heavily inspired by Fast AI fastbook.

All notebooks are provided as is. Those nbs that are used in a specific guided dive session are tested and possibly updated before the session, but they are not updated unless they are used.
